# Local symmetry of ice, cages and rings

Copyright (c) d-SEAMS developers

d-SEAMS can match a local environment to an ideal ice shell, a clathrate
cage or a ring, and can name the point group of that cluster and the space
group of a crystal. The match is optional at build time.

## Which code the recollection points to

The Japanese code is spglib, by Atsushi Togo.

The other codes in this note were checked against that recollection.

- spglib is the crystal-symmetry library written by Atsushi Togo (National
  Institute for Materials Science). Its methods paper is Togo, Shinohara and
  Tanaka, Science and Technology of Advanced Materials: Methods 4, 2384822
  (2024), doi:10.1080/27660400.2024.2384822. pymatgen's `SpacegroupAnalyzer`
  is documented as an interface to that library, not as a separate symmetry
  engine.
- moyo, and its Python binding moyopy, are also by a Japanese author, Kohei
  Shinohara, who coauthors the 2024 spglib paper. The moyo repository was
  created in October 2023 inside the spglib organisation, and the citation
  the project asks for is a January 2026 figshare deposit
  (doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.31081162). A rewrite that recent is named moyo.
  The code one remembers as "a Japanese code" for space groups, from the
  years this engine has called external symmetry tools, is spglib.
- GenIce and cycless are Masakazu Matsumoto's ice-network codes (Okayama).
  This repository already cites them as ring and lattice generators
  (doi:10.1002/jcc.25077, doi:10.1063/5.0198056). They build hydrogen-bond
  networks and count cycles. They do not find point groups or space groups,
  so they are not the symmetry code in that recollection.
- SHAPE and the continuous shape measure are not Japanese. The measure is
  Pinsky and Avnir, Inorganic Chemistry 37, 5575 (1998),
  doi:10.1021/ic9804925. The Alvarez program is the Barcelona implementation.

## What this engine calls

| Piece | Role here | Licence we found | Vendored? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IRA and SOFI | Rotation, permutation and RMSD; point groups of cages and rings | GPL-3.0-or-later OR Apache-2.0 (MAMMASMIAS, `LICENSE.txt`) | No. Linked when `with_ira` finds libira. The Apache-2.0 choice is compatible with MIT. Taking the GPL-3.0 choice instead would conflict with shipping the combined work under MIT only, so that choice is not used. |
| spglib | Space groups of crystalline regions | BSD-3-Clause | No. Linked when `with_spglib` finds libsymspg. BSD-3-Clause is compatible with MIT. |
| moyo / moyopy | Same crystal-symmetry job as spglib, in Rust | Apache-2.0 for moyo; MIT OR Apache-2.0 for moyopy | No. Not linked. It duplicates spglib. |
| pymatgen `SpacegroupAnalyzer` and `PointGroupAnalyzer` | Python interface over spglib, plus a molecular point-group search | MIT | No. Not linked. The space-group call is the spglib call. |
| continuous-symmetry-measure/shape | Continuous shape measure | GPL-2.0 | No. GPL-2.0 conflicts with MIT for a combined work. |
| SHAPE (Llunell, Casanova, Cirera, Alemany, Alvarez) | Continuous shape measures of polyhedra | No OSI licence in the binary distribution we could inspect | No. |
| OVITO | Polyhedral template matching in the GUI and Python module | GPL-3.0 | No. Not linked. A benchmark may call an installed module. |
| polyhedral-template-matching (P. M. Larsen) | The PTM reference implementation | MIT | No. Not linked. |
| GenIce2 | Ice and clathrate lattices | MIT | No. |
| cycless | Ring cycles used by GenIce | No `LICENSE` file at the repository root we fetched | No. |

Ideal templates are generated in `local_symmetry.cpp`. No trajectory frames are stored in the tree.

## Templates

Oxygen–oxygen nearest-neighbour distance 2.75 Å.

- ice Ic: the central oxygen, its four tetrahedral neighbours, and the twelve second neighbours of the cubic diamond net.
- ice Ih: the same seventeen-atom shell with one bond eclipsed, the geometry of hexagonal ice.
- ice Isd: the same shell with two eclipsed bonds, the local geometry of a stacking fault. CHILL+ has no label for that shell. It can call the oxygen cubic, hexagonal, interfacial or water, and it does not name the fault.
- 5^12: regular dodecahedron, the small cage of both sI and sII.
- 5^12 6^2: the D6d tetrakaidecahedron, the large cage of sI.
- 5^12 6^4: the Td hexakaidecahedron, the large cage of sII. Three orbit seeds are expanded by the tetrahedral group.
- ring-5 and ring-6: regular pentagon and hexagon.

A bulk oxygen is compared with the ice shells by taking itself and its sixteen nearest periodic neighbours, and only when the sixteenth neighbour lies inside 5 Å. sI and sII are told apart by which large-cage template wins. CHILL+ labels both cage vertex sets from the bond list alone and does not carry a cage name.

## Build

```
meson setup build -Dwith_ira=auto -Dwith_spglib=auto
```

`auto` links the library when pkg-config or the linker can see it. `enabled` fails the configure when the library is missing. A build without libira still matches equal-sized templates with the Kabsch-Hungarian search. A build without libsymspg still matches and, when libira is present, still names point groups. Space groups then return status 2.

The command is `seams symmetry`. The C entry points are `seams_symmetry_match`, `seams_symmetry_point_group`, `seams_symmetry_space_group`, `seams_symmetry_template` and `seams_symmetry_crystal` in `seams_c_api.h`. Python is `bindings/python/symmetry.py`.
