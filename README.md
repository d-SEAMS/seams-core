# Compilation with Nix

We use a deterministic build system to generate both bug reports and uniform
usage statistics. This also handles the `lua` scripting engine.

\note The lua functions are documented on the [wiki](https://docs.dseams.info/md_markdown_luafunctions)

## Build

Since this project is built with `nix`, we can simply do the following from the
root directory (longer method):

```sh
# Make sure there are no artifacts
rm -rf build
# This will take a long time the first time as it builds the dependencies
nix-build . # Optional
# Install into your path
nix-env -if . # Required
# Run the command anywhere
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

A faster method of building the software is by using the [cachix binary cache](https://dseams.cachix.org/) as shown:

```bash
# Install cachix
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
# Use the binary cache
cachix use dseams
# Faster with the cache than building from scratch
nix-build . # Optional
# Install into your path
nix-env -if . # Required
# Run the command anywhere
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

\note The paths in the `.yml` should be **relative to the folder from which the binary is called**.

If you're confused about how to handle the relative paths, run the command `yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml` in the top-level directory, and set the paths relative to the top-level directory. This is the convention used in the examples as well.

### Language Server Support

To generate a `compile_commands.json` file for working with a language server
like [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) use the following commands:

```sh
# Pure environment
nix-shell --run 'bash' --pure
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES ../
cp compile_commands.json ../
```

Note that there is no need to actually compile the project if you simply need to
get the compiler database for the language server.

**Do Not** commit the `.json` file.

## Development

We can simply use the `nix` environment:

```sh
# From the project root
nix-shell
```

# Running

This is built completely with nix:

```{bash}
# Install systemwide
nix-env -if .
```

To run the sample inputs, simply install the software, and ensure that `input/` is a child directory.

```{bash}
# Assuming you are in the src directory
# Check help with -h
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

## Tests

Apart from the [examples](https://docs.dseams.info/pages.html), the test-suite
can be run with the `yodaStruct_test` binary, which will drop into the
`nix` environment before building and executing `gdb`:

```{bash}
# Just run this
./testBuild.sh
# quit gdb with quit
# Go run the test binary
cd shellBuild
./yodaStruct_test
```

Do note that the regular installation via `nix-env` runs the tests before the installation

# Developer Documentation

<!-- TODO: Move this to some other location. -->

Test the build with nix:

```bash
nix-build .
# Outputs are in ./result
# If you get a CMake error
rm -rf build
nix-store --delete /nix/store/$whatever # $whatever is the derivation complaining
nix-collect-garbage # then try again [worst case scenario]
```

## Leaks and performance

While testing for leaks, use `clang` (for
[AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer)
and
[LeakSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer))
and the following:

```{bash}
# From the developer shell
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ && export CC=/usr/bin/clang
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-pg -fsanitize=address " -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg
```
