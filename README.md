# Compilation

We use a deterministic build system to generate both bug reports and uniform
usage statistics. This also handles the `lua` scripting engine.

\note The lua functions are documented on the [on the API Docs](https://docs.dseams.info/md_markdown_luafunctions)

We also provide a `conda` environment as a fallback, which is also recommended for MacOS users.

## Build

### Conda (working now)

Although we strongly suggest using `nix`, for MacOS systems, the following
instructions may be more suitable. We will assume the presence of [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html):

```bash
cd ~/seams-core
micromamba create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate dseams
luarocks install luafilesystem
```

Now the installation can proceed.

\note we do not install `lua-luafilesystem` within the `conda` environment because it is outdated on `osx`

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
export EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=$CONDA_PREFIX/include/eigen3
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX ../
make -j$(nproc)
make install
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib $CONDA_PREFIX/bin/yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

We have opted to install into the `conda` environment, if this is not the
intended behavior, use `/usr/local` instead.

### Spack (not working at the moment)

Manually this can be done in a painful way as follows:

```bash
spack install eigen@3.3.9 lua@5.2
spack install catch2 fmt yaml-cpp openblas boost cmake ninja meson
spack load catch2 fmt yaml-cpp openblas boost cmake ninja meson eigen@3.3.9 lua@5.2
luarocks install luafilesystem
```

Or better:

```bash
spack env activate $(pwd)
# After loading the packages
luarocks install luafilesystem
```

Now we can build and install as usual.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
 -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES -GNinja \
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local \
 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-pg -fsanitize=address " \
 -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg \
 -DBUILD_TESTING=NO
cmake --build build
```

Or more reasonably:

```bash
export INST_DIR=$HOME/.local
cd src
meson setup bbdir --prefix $INST_DIR
meson compile -C bbdir
meson install -C bbdir
# if not done
export PATH=$PATH:$INST_DIR/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$INST_DIR/lib
cd ../
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

### Nix (not working at the moment)

Since this project is built with `nix`, we can simply do the following from the
root directory (longer method):

```sh
# Make sure there are no artifacts
rm -rf build
# This will take a long time the first time as it builds the dependencies
nix-build . # Optional
# Install into your path
nix-env -if . # Required
# Run the command anywhere
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

A faster method of building the software is by using the [cachix binary cache](https://dseams.cachix.org/) as shown:

```bash
# Install cachix
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
# Use the binary cache
cachix use dseams
# Faster with the cache than building from scratch
nix-build . # Optional
# Install into your path
nix-env -if . # Required
# Run the command anywhere
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

### Usage

Having installed the `yodaStruct` binary and library, we can now use it.

```bash
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

\note The paths in the `.yml` should be **relative to the folder from which the binary is called**.

If you're confused about how to handle the relative paths, run the command `yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml` in the top-level directory, and set the paths relative to the top-level directory. This is the convention used in the examples as well.

### Language Server Support

To generate a `compile_commands.json` file for working with a language server
like [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) use the following commands:

```sh
# Pure environment
nix-shell --pure
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES ../
cp compile_commands.json ../
```

Note that there is no need to actually compile the project if you simply need to
get the compiler database for the language server.

**Do Not** commit the `.json` file.

## Development

We can simply use the `nix` environment:

```sh
# From the project root
nix-shell --pure
```

# Running

This is built completely with nix:

```{bash}
# Install systemwide
nix-env -if .
```

To run the sample inputs, simply install the software, and ensure that `input/` is a child directory.

```{bash}
# Assuming you are in the src directory
# Check help with -h
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```

## Tests

Apart from the [examples](https://docs.dseams.info/pages.html), the test-suite
can be run with the `yodaStruct_test` binary, which will drop into the
`nix` environment before building and executing `gdb`:

```{bash}
# Just run this
./testBuild.sh
# At this point the binary and library are copied into the root
# One might, in a foolhardy attempt, use gdb at this point
# Here be dragons :)
# USE NIX
# Anyway
gdb --args ./yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
# quit gdb with quit
# Go run the test binary
cd shellBuild
./yodaStruct_test
```

Do note that the regular installation via `nix-env` runs the tests before the installation

# Developer Documentation

<!-- TODO: Move this to some other location. -->

While developing, it is sometimes expedient to update the packages used. It is
then useful to note that we use [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv/) to handle our pinned packages (apart from
the ones built from Github). Thus, one might need, say:

```bash
niv update nixpkgs -b nixpkgs-unstable
```

Test the build with nix:

```bash
nix-build .
# Outputs are in ./result
# If you get a CMake error
rm -rf build
nix-store --delete /nix/store/$whatever # $whatever is the derivation complaining
nix-collect-garbage # then try again [worst case scenario]
```

## Leaks and performance

While testing for leaks, use `clang` (for
[AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer)
and
[LeakSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer))
and the following:

```{bash}
# From the developer shell
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ && export CC=/usr/bin/clang
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-pg -fsanitize=address " -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg -DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-pg
```

# Contributing

Please ensure that all contributions are formatted according to the
[clang-format](./clang-format) configuration file.

Specifically, consider using the following:

- [Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/rosshemsley/SublimeClangFormat) for users
  of Sublime Text

- [format-all](https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code) for Emacs
- [vim-clang-format](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-clang-format) for Vim
- Visual Studio: http://llvm.org/builds/, or use the [integrated support in Visual Studio 2017](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/03/13/clangformat-support-in-visual-studio-2017-15-7-preview-1/)
- Xcode: https://github.com/travisjeffery/ClangFormat-Xcode

Where some of the above suggestions are derived from [this depreciated githook](https://github.com/andrewseidl/githook-clang-format).

Also, do note that we have a `CONTRIBUTING` file you **need to read** to
contribute, for certain reasons, like, common sense.

## Commit Hook
Note that we expect compliance with the `clang-format` as mentioned above, and this may be enforced by using the provided scripts for a pre-commit hook:
```bash
./scripts/git-pre-commit-format install
```

This will ensure that new commits are in accordance to the `clang-format` file.

## Development Builds

The general idea is to drop into an interactive shell with the dependencies and then use `cmake` as usual.

```bash
nix-shell --pure --run bash --show-trace --verbose
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DNO_WARN=TRUE \
 -DFIND_EIGEN=TRUE \
 -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 \
 -G "Ninja"
ninja
# Test
cd ../
yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
# Debug
gdb --args yodaStruct -c lua_inputs/config.yml
```
To load debugging symbols from the shared library, when you are inside `gdb` (from the top-level directory, for instance), use the following command:

```bash
add-symbol-file build/libyodaLib.so
```
Then you can set breakpoints in the C++ code; for instance: 

```bash
b seams_input.cpp:408
```
