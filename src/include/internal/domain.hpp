/** @file domain.hpp
 *  @brief Spatial domain decomposition of one periodic frame across ranks.
 *
 *  The box is cut into slabs, pencils, or blocks, whichever keeps the most
 *  owned volume for a halo of the given width. A rank owns one block. Its
 *  halo is every atom within that width of the block, periodic boundaries
 *  included, and nothing further. A kernel whose answer for an atom depends
 *  only on atoms within that width can run on the owned and halo atoms alone
 *  and agree with the whole frame on the owned ones.
