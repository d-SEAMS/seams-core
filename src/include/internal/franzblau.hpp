/** @brief Functions for generating primitive rings.
 *         This namespace contains struct definitions and functions that are
 * used for generating primitive (shortest-path) rings (directed cyclic graphs).
 *
 * The Vertex object is a collection of elements for each point, required for
 * graph traversal. The Graph object is an object for the whole frame,
 * containing the information of all vertices, and a row-ordered vector of
 * vector of the rings generated.
 *
 * The <a
 * href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.44.4925">Franzblau
 * shortest-path criterion</a> has been used. The SP (shortest-path) criterion
 * is midway between the least restrictive and most restrictive criteria in the
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * The following is the procedure for finding primitive rings:
 *
 * 1. All possible rings (including non-SP) rings are found, in the
 * primitive::countAllRingsFromIndex function, using the <a
 * href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/website/CombinatorialAlgorithms.pdf">backtracking
 * algorithm</a>. This is a recursive algorithm.
 *
 * 2. The non-SP rings are then removed from the list of all rings, using the
 * Franzblau shortest path criterion (primitive::removeNonSPrings), answered
 * by a hop-bounded breadth-first sweep per vertex.
