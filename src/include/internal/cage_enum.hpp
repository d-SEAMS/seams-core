/** @file cage_enum.hpp
 *  @brief Signature-guided enumeration of polyhedral cages.
 *
 *  A cage is a connected set of primitive rings (faces) whose size
 *  census matches a Signature and whose edges form a closed
 *  polyhedron: every edge of every face is shared by exactly two
 *  faces of the set, at least three faces around each vertex form
 *  one cycle, and V - E + F = 2, so the faces tile a sphere.
 *  Production entry points pass rings through ring::cageRings first:
 *  a ring whose minimum-image lattice shifts sum to a nonzero winding
 *  is not a face, and a cutoff that can see two images of one pair is
 *  refused. Growth
 *  walks the ring adjacency graph (two rings are adjacent when they
 *  share an edge) and stays inside the signature budget. Distinct
 *  cages are the distinct sorted vertex sets, listed by their sorted
 *  faces; the nauty certificate, when linked, names the isomorphism
 *  class of each cage.
