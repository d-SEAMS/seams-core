/** @brief CHILL and CHILL+ structure classification.
 *         This namespace contains functions that are used in the
CHILL/CHILL+ classification scheme, as well as a yodaCloud struct to hold
 all the information.
 *
 Both the <a
href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2010/cp/b919724a">CHILL</a>
and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp510289t">CHILL+</a> methods
are based on the <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.471721">local
bond order parameter method</a>, developed by ten Wolde et al. for the
identification of crystal nuclei in Lennard-Jones systems. The local order
 parameter method is based on <a
href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1297">order
parameters</a> introduced by Steinhardt et al.

 The local environment of the water molecules is classified using an algorithm
based on spherical harmonics, which is independent of the specific crystal
structure and does not require the definition of a reference frame. The local
order around each water molecule @f$i@f$ is described by a local orientational
bond order parameter @f$q_{lm}(i)@f$, with @f$ 2l+1 @f$ complex components:

  @f[
  q_{lm}(i) = @frac{1}{N_b(i)} \Sigma_{j=1}^{N_b(i)} Y_{lm}(r_{ij})
  @f]

  Here, @f$N_b(i)=4@f$ is the number of nearest neighbours for water molecule
@f$i@f$, @f$l@f$ is a free integer parameter, @f$m@f$ is an integer such that
@f$m \in [-l,l]@f$. The functions @f$Y_{lm}(r_{ij})@f$ are the spherical
harmonics and @f$r_{ij}@f$ is the distance vector between molecule @f$i@f$ and
each one of its four nearest neighbours @f$j@f$.

  The alignment of the orientation of the local structures is measured by the
normalized dot product of the local orientational bond order parameter,
\f$q_l(i)\f$, between each pair of neighbor molecules \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$, given
by:

  @f[
  a(i,j) = \frac{\sum_{m=-l}^{l} q_{lm}(i)\, q_{lm}^*(j)}
  {|q_l(i)|\,|q_l(j)|}
  @f]

  where, @f$q_{lm}^*@f$ is the complex conjugate of @f$q_{lm}@f$.

  Depending on the values of @f$a(i,j)@f$, the bond between each pair of
molecules @f$i@f$ and @f$j@f$ is classified as being either staggered or
eclipsed.

  @code
  Algorithm   Eclipsed bonds              Staggered bonds
  CHILL       -0.05 >= a(i,j) >= -0.2     a(i,j) <= -0.8
  CHILL+      0.25 >= a(i,j) >= -0.35     a(i,j) <= -0.8
  @endcode

  Since each molecule @f$i@f$ in deeply supercooled water has four nearest
neighbours, the type of the resultant four bonds is used to identify phases
according to the CHILL and CHILL+ algorithms.

  The CHILL algorithm can classify water molecules as belonging to the cubic,
hexagonal, interfacial or liquid (amorphous) phase:

  @code
  Phase        E    S    Neighbours  Description
  Cubic        0    4    4           All 4 neighbours are staggered.
  Hexagonal    1    3    4           3 staggered and 1 eclipsed bond.
  Interfacial  any  2    4           Belongs to the ice phase, but does not satisfy strict criteria of cubic and hexagonal.
               0    3    4
  Liquid       N/A  N/A  any         Classification by exclusion.
  @endcode

  Here, E and S refer to eclipsed and staggered bonds. The neighbours column
contains the number of nearest neighbours.

  The CHILL+ algorithm, which is a modified version of CHILL, additionally
identifies clathrate and interfacial clathrate phases. The criteria are
  enumerated in the table below:

  @code
  Phase                  E    S    Neighbours  Description
  Cubic                  0    4    4           no change was made to the staggered bond criterion from CHILL
  Hexagonal              1    3    4           wider eclipsed range compared to CHILL; identifies 99% hexagonal ice up to 270 K
  Interfacial            any  2    4           must have at least one first neighbor water with more than two staggered bonds
                         0    3    4           must have at least one first neighbor water with more than one staggered bond
  Clathrate              4    0    4           bulk clathrate and part of the interface of clathrates can be identified with four eclipsed bonds
  Interfacial clathrate  3    any  4           partial clathrate cages and threads of clathrate-like order
  Liquid                 N/A  N/A  any         classifies as liquid if none of the above criteria are fulfilled
  @endcode

  Although both the CHILL and CHILL+ classification schemes take into account
the local order of the environment of each particle, both schemes output a
per-particle classification.
